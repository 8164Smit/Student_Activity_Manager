🎓 Student Activity Manager is a simple and efficient React-based project designed to help track student attendance and activities with ease.

⚡ Built using React + Vite, it offers fast performance, clean structure, and smooth UI rendering.

📝 Users can add new students, manage their status, and view overall activity at a glance.

👇 The interface includes an intuitive input bar to enter names and instantly register a new student.

🔄 A Reset button allows users to quickly clear all data and start fresh whenever needed.

📊 The application automatically displays important statistics such as Total Students, Present Count, and Absent Count.

📦 All student entries are displayed in clean, separate cards, making the UI visually organized and easy to navigate.

🧩 Each student card includes options to mark them as present or absent, giving users full control over activity updates.

❌ If no students are added, a clear “No Students Found” message appears for a minimal and polished experience.

🎨 The layout is fully centered and styled with a modern, responsive design that looks smooth on all screen sizes.

🚀 This project is perfect for beginners learning React state management, event handling, and reusable component structure.
